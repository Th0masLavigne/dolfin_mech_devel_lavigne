.. py:module:: dolfin_mech.problems.problem_hyperelasticity_inverse

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Defines the InverseHyperelasticity class.

   Specialized problem manager for
   reconstructing the stress-free reference configuration of a body from its
   known deformed geometry, frequently used for analyzing medical imaging data.

.. py:class:: InverseHyperelasticity(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dolfin_mech.problems.problem_hyperelasticity.Hyperelasticity`


   Problem class for solving inverse hyperelasticity problems.

   Inverse hyperelasticity is typically used to find the stress-free
   configuration (reference state) of a body when only the deformed geometry
   is known. This is a common requirement in medical imaging (e.g., estimating
   the unloaded shape of an organ from a CT scan).



   This class inherits from :class:`HyperelasticityProblem` but overrides the
   kinematic framework and specific operators to account for the fact that the
   computational mesh represents the deformed configuration.

   .. note::
       Incompressibility constraints via mixed formulations are currently
       not supported in this inverse implementation.


   .. py:method:: set_kinematics()

      Initializes the inverse kinematic framework.

      Instead of the standard deformation gradient :math:`\mathbf{F}`, this
      method sets up :class:`InverseKinematics` which treats the current
      mesh coordinates as the spatial frame.

      It registers the following inverse fields as Fields of Interest (FOI):
          * **F**: Inverse deformation gradient :math:`\mathbf{f} = \partial \mathbf{X} / \partial \mathbf{x}`.
          * **J**: Determinant of the inverse deformation gradient.
          * **C**: Right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor in the inverse context.
          * **E**: Green-Lagrange strain tensor derived from inverse mapping.



   .. py:method:: add_elasticity_operator(material_model, material_parameters, subdomain_id=None)

      Adds an elasticity operator tailored for the inverse formulation.

      Even though the problem is hyperelastic, the inverse formulation often
      utilizes a linearized operator structure relative to the spatial
      coordinates of the deformed mesh.

      :param material_model: Name of the constitutive model.
      :type material_model: str
      :param material_parameters: Parameters for the material model.
      :type material_parameters: dict
      :param subdomain_id: Optional ID to restrict the operator to a subdomain.
      :type subdomain_id: int, optional
      :return: The added elasticity operator.
