dolfin_mech.core.step
=====================

.. py:module:: dolfin_mech.core.step

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Defines the Step class.

   Manages a single temporal or loading interval
   within a numerical simulation, including its time-stepping strategy,
   governing operators, and boundary constraints.

.. py:class:: Step(t_ini=0.0, t_fin=1.0, dt_ini=None, dt_min=None, dt_max=None, operators=None, constraints=None)

   Class representing a single time step or load step in a simulation.

   A ``Step`` defines a time interval :math:`[t_{ini}, t_{fin}]` and the
   associated time-stepping strategy (initial, minimum, and maximum ``dt``).
   It also acts as a container for all **Operators** (physics terms) and
   **Constraints** (boundary conditions) that are active during this specific interval.



   This structure allows for multi-stage simulations where boundary conditions
   or physics change over time (e.g., inflation followed by relaxation).

   :param t_ini: Start time of the step.
   :type t_ini: float
   :param t_fin: End time of the step.
   :type t_fin: float
   :param dt_ini: Initial time increment :math:`\Delta t` to attempt. Defaults to the full step duration.
   :type dt_ini: float
   :param dt_min: Minimum allowable time increment (for adaptive refinement). Defaults to ``dt_ini``.
   :type dt_min: float
   :param dt_max: Maximum allowable time increment. Defaults to ``dt_ini``.
   :type dt_max: float
   :param operators: List of operator objects active in this step.
   :type operators: list
   :param constraints: List of constraint objects active in this step.
   :type constraints: list
