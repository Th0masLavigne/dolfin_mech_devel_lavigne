# ROSALY hydrogels

Welcome to the documentation of **rosaly_hydrogels**.

This package provides a high-level wrapper for  [dolfin_mech](https://github.com/mgenet/dolfin_mech)
([docs](https://th0maslavigne.github.io/dolfin_mech_doc/)) (FEniCS-based) simulations of
hydrogel mechanics, including specialized material models, mesh generation
for complex geometries (like the cornea), and poroelastic operators.
